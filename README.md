# CS4450-Interpreter

Welcome to team Arbok's Python interpreter. We made it with Python!

Sorry that's a super old meme...

Anyways, you're probably wondering how to use this code.

## Usage

Clone the code to your machine. There are no dependencies, so you won't need a virtual environment or anything like that. Cd to the CS4450-Interpreter directory.

With Python version 3, run the following (your path variable may just be 'python'):

```python3 interpreter.py python_test_code.py```

The interpreter will then run your code!

This, of course, is not a FULL Python interpreter. It was made to satisfy the requirements of the python_test_code.py file. It shouldn't have trouble running any basic code you give it though.
