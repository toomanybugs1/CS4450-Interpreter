# CS4450-Interpreter

Welcome to team Arbok's Python interpreter. We made it with Python!

Sorry that's a super old meme...

Anyways, you're probably wondering how to use this code.

## Usage

Clone the code to your machine. There are no dependencies, so you won't need a virtual environment or anything like that. Cd to the CS4450-Interpreter directory.

With Python version 3, run the following (your path variable may just be 'python'):

```python3 interpreter.py <your python file here>```

The interpreter will then run your code!

So far, we have only implemented str() and print(), but there are more library methods in the works. At this moment, there aren't loops, conditionals, or functions.
